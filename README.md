# Legal Document Comparison and Data Extraction Tool

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is designed to **automate the comparison of legal documents** using Python-based **OCR** and structured text extraction. The tool streamlines quality assurance for large-scale document review by detecting deviations across **1500+ page** legal files.

### 🔹 **Key Features:**
- **OCR-Powered Comparison** → Uses `pytesseract` to extract text from scanned documents.
- **Structured Text Extraction** → Uses `pdfplumber` to compare PDF content directly.
- **LLM Integration (Llama 3.2)** → Adapts to diverse legal document templates (e.g., headers, footers).
- **Bluebeam Revu Automation** → Overlays detected differences visually, reducing **100+ manual hours**.
